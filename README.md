# Kernel_Upstream_Patches

This is a repo containing linux kernel upstrem patches. If you wish to upstream your kernel from LP to MM or from MM to N, then you've come to the right place.

`` All you have to do is to find the right appropriate kernel for your source and commit on your repo ``

<b>Note:-</b> The patch has been tested by me and my friend. So before reporting issues just test it wisely. If you encounter any issue then you may contact your developer or else me. :)

`` Instead of using patch command for automatic merging the commits, update these commits manually because i've not properly created this patch to work fine with -patch commands. I will soon make this patch to be work with patch command so that you can easily update your commits. ``
